# 🌐 Amina Haque — Personal Website

Welcome to the GitHub repository for my [personal website](https://aminahaque27.github.io/personal-website/)! I'm Amina Haque, a recent Computer Science graduate and incoming Master's student at the University of Texas at Dallas. This site serves as a central hub for my professional background, projects, and technical portfolio.

## 🔍 About Me

I'm passionate about building meaningful software solutions that combine technical rigor with thoughtful user experience. With hands-on experience in full-stack development, machine learning, UI/UX, and agile collaboration, I'm excited to grow in the software engineering field.

I’ve worked on everything from trading automation to educational platforms and weather-based climate forecasting tools. I’m particularly interested in the intersection of software engineering, AI, and design.
